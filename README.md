<h1>UBC BEST Phototherapy</h1>
<p>Welcome to the UBC BEST Phototherapy Monitor GitHub Repository</p>
<p>Phototherapy is used in the Newborn Units to treat babies with jaundice. Multiple medical professionals in both Kenya and Uganda expressed the uncertainty in knowing if the lights used by the devices were working effectively. Although light is being emitted, there is no indication that there is enough blue light present for the bulb to be therapeutic. A consequence of insufficient blue light radiation is that babies are left under the phototherapy light for long periods of time, which has adverse side effects on the baby such as skin damage.</p>
<p>The end goal of this project is to create a device that can monitor the level of blue light being emitted from phototherapy bulbs, notifying the doctors and nurses if the lamp is inefficient/ineffective. The device will either be attached to the unit or be a separate entity that is placed under the light momentarily. We aim to produce this device in under $70 CAD, which is approximately a 90% reduction in price compared to medical grade Bili meters in the market. Our first functional prototype is shown below. Our team of 13 brilliant engineering and science students is now working to increase precision and lower the cost of our device.</p>
